My wife runs an art studio. We've started advertising it in google in May 2019. We are now very frustrated with how easyily google managed to dishonestly charge $800 with chances of getting this refunded seems pretty slim. I can easily see how this might have happend to other small time businesses like ours. Looking for some advice as to how we should proceed here.

For the curious, here's a more detailed turn of events:

1. May 21- I have created two display ads campaigns with basic initial setup. For some reason these campaings did not serve any ads. 
2. Jun 3 and Jul 4- Spent time on these two occasions to get the campaigns to work. I tweaked budgests, labels, topics, keywords and what not... nothing worked. I even called google support at some point but did not get any meaningul feedback. So I basically lost interest and abondend this effort.
3. Dec 5- The campaigns suddenly started to serve ads at top velocity ($200/day, twice the budget). Since I have made absolutly no change prior and since the campaigns actually *never* worked before I definitely was not expecting this.
4. Dec 8- I cought on this after four days (since google charges once debt goes over $500) and disabled the capaigns immediately. Needless to say, I honestly never intended to spend so much! Since the campaigns never worked anyway, it did not occued to me to dial the budgets down (I initially planned on specding maybe 1/5  as much) or to diasable them.
5. Dec 9- Called google support to understand why this had happened. I was told by the agent that google indeed *made some internal changes* at in the beginning of December which caused the behaviour change. These changes were done without my consent or knowledge. I asked to get a refund, which the agent agreed is warranted. She then proceeded to get the proper approvals within google to get a refund.
6. Dev 26- google reached out to me and suggested a credit of $400 for future spends. This is entirelly unsatisfactory as we do not wish to use the service any longer.
